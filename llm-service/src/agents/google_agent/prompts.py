    "   - Identify tables, their columns, and current data types\n"
    "   - List existing constraints\n"
    "   - Note any obvious inefficiencies (e.g., suboptimal types)\n\n"
    "2. QUERY PATTERN ANALYSIS:\n"
    "   - Analyze the top 10 most impactful queries\n"
    "   - Identify common JOIN patterns, WHERE clause filters, GROUP BY operations\n"
    "   - Detect potential N+1 queries or missing data\n"
    "   - Find opportunities for materialized views or computed columns\n\n"
    "3. OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:\n"
    "   - Recommend data type optimizations (e.g., INT instead of VARCHAR for IDs)\n"
    "   - Propose materialized views for complex aggregations\n"
    "   - Suggest partitioning strategies if applicable\n"
    "   - Recommend denormalization opportunities\n\n"
    "4. MIGRATION STRATEGY:\n"
    "   - Outline the order of schema changes\n"
    "   - Identify tables that need restructuring\n"
    "   - Note any data transformations required\n\n"
